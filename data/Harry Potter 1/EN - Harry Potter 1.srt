1
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,806
PRIVET DRIVE

2
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:26,747
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:41,147
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,627
Are the rumors true, Albus?

5
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:52,107
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

6
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:55,587
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

7
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,747
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

8
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:05,147
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

9
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:28,147
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

10
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:32,227
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:36,907
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

12
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:40,187
Try not to wake him.

13
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:43,067
There you go.

14
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:53,027
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

15
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:58,507
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

16
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:02,707
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

17
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:07,907
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

18
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,867
Exactly.

19
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:14,347
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

20
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,587
Until he's ready.

21
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:37,067
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

22
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Mr and Mrs V. Dursley
4 Privet Drive, Surrey

23
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,427
Good luck...

24
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,587
...Harry Potter.

25
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,700
HARRY POTTER
AND PHILOSOPHER'S STONE

26
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:14,147
Up. Get up!

27
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,307
Now!

28
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:35,347
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

29
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:51,827
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

30
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,827
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

31
00:04:57,027 --> 00:05:01,987
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

32
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:05,147
...for my Dudley's special day!

33
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:10,347
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

34
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:14,667
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

35
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:20,347
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

36
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:23,787
36?! But last year I had 37!

37
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:27,867
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

38
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,587
This is what we're going to do.

39
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:35,147
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

40
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:42,747
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

41
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,867
I'm warning you now, boy.

42
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:51,587
Any funny business, any at all...

43
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:54,867
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

44
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,347
Get in.

45
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,947
Make it move.

46
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:11,307
Move!

47
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:14,027
- Move!
- He's asleep!

48
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,787
He's boring.

49
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:20,667
Sorry about him.

50
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:24,587
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

51
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:28,947
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

52
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:34,387
Can you hear me?

53
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:40,947
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

54
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:42,827
Do you?

55
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:47,147
Do you talk to people often?

56
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:51,587
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

57
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,067
Do you miss your family?

58
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,668
Bred in captivity

59
00:06:56,947 --> 00:07:01,667
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

60
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:06,867
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

61
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:31,987
Thanks.

62
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:33,627
Anytime.

63
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,867
Snake!

64
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:57,667
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

65
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:01,067
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

66
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:06,627
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

67
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:16,827
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

68
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:21,507
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

69
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:25,587
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

70
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,787
There's no such thing as magic.

71
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:48,937
And smile!

72
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:53,337
Vernon, look at him!
I can't believe it!

73
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:56,017
In a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

74
00:08:56,257 --> 00:09:00,017
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

75
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:03,337
Will I have to wear that too?

76
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,697
What? Go to Smeltings?

77
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:15,697
Don't be stupid!
You're going to the state school.

78
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:19,457
This is what you'll wear
when I finish dyeing it.

79
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:24,017
That's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit like old elephant skin.

80
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,457
Fit you well enough.

81
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:30,417
Go get the post. Go!

82
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Mr. H. Potter
...under the Stairs...

83
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:03,017
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

84
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:06,417
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

85
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:09,377
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

86
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:45,217
No more mail through this letterbox.

87
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:33,717
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

88
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:39,277
Shoo! Go on.

89
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,997
Fine day, Sunday.

90
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:12,317
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

91
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:16,957
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

92
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,917
No post on Sunday.

93
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:25,237
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

94
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:30,797
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

95
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:43,077
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

96
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,797
Make it stop, please!

97
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:00,517
Stop it!

98
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:07,597
Mummy, what's happening?

99
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:15,357
Give me that! Give me that letter!

100
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,757
Get off!

101
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:27,677
They're my letters! Let go of me!

102
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,517
That's it! We're going away!

103
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,837
Far away, where they can't find us!

104
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:39,317
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

105
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
HAPPY BIRTH DAY

106
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,517
Make a wish, Harry.

107
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,677
Who's there?

108
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:49,277
Sorry about that.

109
00:14:56,157 --> 00:15:00,717
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

110
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,437
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

111
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:15,157
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

112
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:19,917
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

113
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:22,957
I'm not Harry.

114
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:28,517
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

115
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,877
Got something for you.

116
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:36,677
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

117
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:42,597
Baked it myself, words and all.

118
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,500
HAPPEE BIRTHDAY
HARRY

119
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,197
Thank you.

120
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:53,557
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

121
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:12,877
Excuse me, but who are you?

122
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:17,997
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

123
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,957
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

124
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:27,477
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

125
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:29,117
Learned what?

126
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:31,877
You're a wizard, Harry.

127
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,117
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

128
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:38,357
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

129
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,477
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

130
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:44,717
...I can't be a wizard.

131
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:50,117
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

132
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:55,197
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

133
00:16:55,437 --> 00:17:00,077
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

134
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:19,597
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

135
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:23,077
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

136
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:28,237
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

137
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:32,677
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

138
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,957
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

139
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:39,877
My perfect sister being who she was.

140
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:46,077
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

141
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:50,437
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

142
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:54,317
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

143
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,277
A freak!

144
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:59,437
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

145
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:05,357
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

146
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:10,597
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

147
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:14,797
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

148
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:19,357
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

149
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,477
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

150
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:26,157
He'll not be going.

151
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:29,677
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

152
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:30,877
Muggle?

153
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:35,237
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

154
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:39,317
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

155
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:45,437
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

156
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:50,477
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

157
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:55,197
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

158
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:57,477
...in front of me.

159
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Momm... get off!

160
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:20,597
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

161
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:24,957
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

162
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:29,237
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

163
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:38,637
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

164
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:56,547
"First years will require
three sets of work robes...

165
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,587
...one wand."

166
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:01,827
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

167
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:06,947
"One pair of dragon hide gloves."
Do they mean from a real dragon?

168
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:10,347
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

169
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:15,587
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

170
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:21,627
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

171
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,987
"All students must be equipped with...

172
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:34,107
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

173
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:40,107
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

174
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,947
Can we find all this in London?

175
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,547
If you know where to go.

176
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:11,267
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

177
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:15,347
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

178
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:18,667
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

179
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:22,467
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

180
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:30,187
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

181
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:34,747
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

182
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:40,467
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

183
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,227
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

184
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:48,427
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

185
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:51,067
Oh, nice to meet you.

186
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:54,387
Fearfully fascinating subject.

187
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:59,227
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

188
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:04,307
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

189
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,267
Goodbye.

190
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:12,587
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

191
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:16,267
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

192
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:20,267
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

193
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:41,027
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

194
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,867
Here, you get your quills and ink.

195
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:04,067
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

196
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,147
It's a world-class racing broom.

197
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:35,267
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

198
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:38,787
It's the fastest model yet.

199
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:47,107
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

200
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:50,667
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

201
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:56,387
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

202
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:13,027
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

203
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:18,507
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

204
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,667
Best stay close.

205
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:28,387
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

206
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:35,787
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

207
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:39,947
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

208
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:45,627
Ha! There's the little devil.

209
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:48,707
And there's something else as well.

210
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,267
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

211
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,600
TOP SECRET

212
00:24:57,347 --> 00:25:01,427
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

213
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:05,667
Very well.

214
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,707
Vault 687.

215
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,947
Lamp, please.

216
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:27,787
Key, please.

217
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:54,987
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

218
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:59,987
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

219
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:04,347
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

220
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:06,147
Stand back.

221
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,227
Best not to mention this to anyone.

222
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:49,587
I still need a wand.

223
00:26:49,787 --> 00:26:53,187
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

224
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:59,027
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

225
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,827
Hello?

226
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,627
Hello?

227
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:31,427
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

228
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:41,467
It seems only yesterday...

229
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:47,547
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

230
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:56,507
Here we are.

231
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:07,627
Give it a wave.

232
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,667
Apparently not.

233
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,307
Perhaps...

234
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:30,107
...this.

235
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:41,787
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

236
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,667
I wonder...

237
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,147
Curious.

238
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:25,267
Very curious.

239
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:28,587
Sorry, but what's curious?

240
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:33,627
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

241
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:36,587
It so happens that the phoenix...

242
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:41,507
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

243
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:44,987
Just one other.

244
00:29:45,187 --> 00:29:49,547
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

245
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:55,467
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

246
00:29:57,307 --> 00:30:00,507
And who owned that wand?

247
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:03,747
We do not speak his name.

248
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:07,707
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

249
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:10,947
It's not always clear why.

250
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:14,827
But I think it is clear...

251
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:18,947
...that we can expect
great things from you.

252
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:23,387
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

253
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,307
...did great things.

254
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:28,547
Terrible...

255
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:32,267
...yes, but great.

256
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:39,907
Harry! Harry!

257
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,667
Happy birthday.

258
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:53,307
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

259
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:59,267
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

260
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:03,107
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

261
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:11,547
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

262
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:14,307
Not all wizards are good.

263
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:16,987
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

264
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:22,227
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

265
00:31:22,427 --> 00:31:26,067
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

266
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,147
No, I can't spell it.

267
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:32,587
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

268
00:31:36,547 --> 00:31:38,827
It was dark times, Harry.

269
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,227
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

270
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:47,827
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

271
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:52,347
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

272
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:56,507
Your parents fought against him.

273
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,507
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

274
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,467
Nobody, not one.

275
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,067
Except you.

276
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:16,187
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

277
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:20,827
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

278
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:26,867
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

279
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:30,707
What happened to V?
To You-Know-Who?

280
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:35,187
Well, some say he died.

281
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:37,827
Codswallop, in my opinion.

282
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:41,307
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

283
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:44,467
...too tired to carry on.

284
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:50,107
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

285
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:54,587
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

286
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:58,747
You're the boy who lived.

287
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,787
What are you looking at?

288
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:14,547
Blimey, is that the time?

289
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:18,747
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

290
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:23,827
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

291
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:29,387
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

292
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
LONDON to HOGWARTS

293
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:34,507
"Platform 93/4"?

294
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:39,507
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

295
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:43,067
There's no such thing, is there?

296
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:03,187
Sorry.

297
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,427
Excuse me. Excuse me.

298
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:09,187
On your left.

299
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:13,227
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

300
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,987
Think you're being funny, do you?

301
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,507
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

302
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:23,347
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

303
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:32,187
All right, Percy, you first.

304
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,387
Fred, you next.

305
00:34:43,587 --> 00:34:47,307
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

306
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:49,467
I'm sorry, George.

307
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:56,027
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

308
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,387
Excuse me.

309
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:08,267
Could you tell me how to?

310
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:12,027
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

311
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,707
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

312
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:20,827
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

313
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:24,507
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

314
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,500
HOGWARTS EXPRESS

315
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:26,347
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

316
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:28,787
Not at all.

317
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:34,267
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

318
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:37,147
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

319
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:40,587
So it's true!

320
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:43,587
I mean, do you really have the?

321
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:47,027
- The what?
- The scar?

322
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,427
Wicked!

323
00:36:54,867 --> 00:37:00,067
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

324
00:37:04,107 --> 00:37:06,387
We'll take the lot.

325
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Wow...

326
00:37:17,107 --> 00:37:21,907
- Bertie Bot's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

327
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:25,707
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

328
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:29,747
...spinach, liver and tripe.

329
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:34,147
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

330
00:37:38,787 --> 00:37:44,147
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

331
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:49,827
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

332
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:53,627
Watch it!

333
00:37:55,627 --> 00:37:59,387
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

334
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:06,187
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

335
00:38:07,947 --> 00:38:09,507
Hey, he's gone!

336
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:13,187
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

337
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:16,907
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

338
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:18,307
A little.

339
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:21,827
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

340
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,107
Yeah.

341
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,467
Has anyone seen a toad?

342
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:35,507
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

343
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:40,427
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

344
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:45,827
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

345
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:49,147
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

346
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:57,547
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

347
00:38:57,747 --> 00:39:01,027
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

348
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:03,827
...but they've all worked for me.

349
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,507
For example:

350
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:12,667
Oculus Reparo.

351
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:17,387
That's better, isn't it?

352
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:22,467
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

353
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:26,267
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are?

354
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:30,187
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

355
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:35,507
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

356
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,107
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

357
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:45,267
Just there.

358
00:39:57,587 --> 00:40:01,387
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

359
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:06,827
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

360
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:16,787
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

361
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:22,227
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

362
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:09,707
Wicked.

363
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:40,107
Welcome to Hogwarts.

364
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:44,347
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

365
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:49,587
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

366
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:52,947
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

367
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:57,587
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

368
00:41:58,027 --> 00:42:03,067
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

369
00:42:03,707 --> 00:42:07,187
Your triumphs will earn you points.

370
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:11,547
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

371
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:17,027
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

372
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:18,587
Trevor!

373
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:29,147
Sorry.

374
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:33,307
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

375
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,987
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

376
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:41,027
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

377
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:42,627
Harry Potter?

378
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,947
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

379
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,427
And I'm Malfoy.

380
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,107
Draco Malfoy.

381
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:56,667
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

382
00:42:56,867 --> 00:43:02,667
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

383
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:07,627
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

384
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:11,627
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

385
00:43:11,827 --> 00:43:14,027
I can help you there.

386
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:20,067
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

387
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:27,907
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

388
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:50,987
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

389
00:43:51,347 --> 00:43:54,227
I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

390
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:10,307
Will you wait along here, please?

391
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:14,547
Now, before we begin...

392
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:17,987
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

393
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:22,987
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

394
00:44:23,387 --> 00:44:25,507
The first years, please note...

395
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:31,787
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

396
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:37,547
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

397
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:42,387
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

398
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:46,907
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

399
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:50,227
Thank you.

400
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:56,067
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

401
00:44:56,267 --> 00:44:59,907
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

402
00:45:00,107 --> 00:45:03,347
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

403
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:06,147
Hermione Granger.

404
00:45:08,427 --> 00:45:11,027
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

405
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:14,787
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

406
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:24,147
Right, then. Right.

407
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,947
Okay. Gryffindor!

408
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:39,547
Draco Malfoy.

409
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:46,307
Slytherin!

410
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:50,187
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

411
00:45:50,387 --> 00:45:52,907
Susan Bones.

412
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,587
Harry, what is it?

413
00:46:03,867 --> 00:46:06,547
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

414
00:46:06,827 --> 00:46:08,227
Let's see...

415
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:12,827
I know! Hufflepuff!

416
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:16,987
Ronald Weasley.

417
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:35,827
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

418
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,827
Gryffindor!

419
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,547
Harry Potter.

420
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:08,627
Difficult, very difficult.

421
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:12,787
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

422
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:15,307
There's talent, oh, yes.

423
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:19,347
And a thirst to prove yourself.

424
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,707
But where to put you?

425
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:24,787
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

426
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:28,667
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

427
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:33,787
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

428
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:39,307
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

429
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:44,267
No? Well, if you're sure.

430
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:46,227
Better be...

431
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,427
...Gryffindor!

432
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:16,747
Your attention, please.

433
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:21,467
Let the feast begin.

434
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:39,947
I'm half and half.

435
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:43,427
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

436
00:48:43,627 --> 00:48:47,147
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

437
00:48:48,147 --> 00:48:51,947
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

438
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:55,387
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

439
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:57,507
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

440
00:48:57,747 --> 00:49:03,307
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

441
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:10,147
Hello! How are you?

442
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:13,787
Welcome to Gryffindor.

443
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:26,387
It's the Bloody Baron!

444
00:49:31,027 --> 00:49:33,787
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

445
00:49:34,027 --> 00:49:39,427
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

446
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:45,387
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

447
00:49:45,627 --> 00:49:48,347
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

448
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:52,067
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

449
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:54,387
Like this.

450
00:50:04,387 --> 00:50:08,227
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

451
00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:12,747
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

452
00:50:13,027 --> 00:50:16,347
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

453
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:20,747
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

454
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:35,667
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

455
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:38,547
That picture's moving.

456
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:42,267
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

457
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:46,347
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

458
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,107
Welcome to Hogwarts.

459
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,707
Password?

460
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,947
Caput Draconis.

461
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:21,587
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

462
00:51:24,307 --> 00:51:26,707
Gather around here.

463
00:51:28,427 --> 00:51:31,707
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

464
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:36,347
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

465
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:39,667
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

466
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,507
Made it!

467
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:54,147
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

468
00:52:57,387 --> 00:53:02,347
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

469
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:06,867
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

470
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:10,267
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

471
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:16,227
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

472
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:30,067
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

473
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,907
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

474
00:53:34,187 --> 00:53:37,867
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

475
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:41,187
However, for those select few...

476
00:53:42,107 --> 00:53:45,427
...who possess the predisposition...

477
00:53:49,107 --> 00:53:52,387
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

478
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:55,547
...and ensnare the senses.

479
00:53:55,747 --> 00:53:58,267
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

480
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:04,427
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

481
00:54:08,467 --> 00:54:13,347
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

482
00:54:13,547 --> 00:54:19,507
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

483
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:22,667
...to not pay attention.

484
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:31,227
Mr. Potter.

485
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:36,267
Our new celebrity.

486
00:54:38,427 --> 00:54:44,227
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

487
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:49,907
You don't know? Let's try again.

488
00:54:50,107 --> 00:54:54,747
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

489
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,427
I don't know, sir.

490
00:54:57,707 --> 00:55:01,547
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

491
00:55:04,107 --> 00:55:06,347
I don't know, sir.

492
00:55:07,427 --> 00:55:08,707
Pity.

493
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:14,667
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

494
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:17,387
...is it, Mr. Potter?

495
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:22,407
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

496
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:25,727
Silence.

497
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:38,887
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

498
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:44,767
For your information, Potter...

499
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:50,447
...asphodel and wormwood make
the Draught of the Living Dead.

500
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:56,007
A bezoar is a stone found in a goat's
stomach and will save you from poison.

501
00:55:56,287 --> 00:56:02,847
Monkshood and wolfsbane are the same
plant, which also goes by aconite.

502
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,607
Well...

503
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:12,047
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

504
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,407
And Gryffindors...

505
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:26,927
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

506
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,447
...for your classmate's cheek.

507
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:52,527
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

508
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:55,287
Eye of rabbit...

509
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:58,287
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

510
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:03,247
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

511
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:11,887
Mail's here.

512
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:47,127
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

513
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:53,247
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

514
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:58,967
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

515
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:02,687
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

516
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:06,407
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

517
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:10,287
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

518
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:16,247
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

519
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,167
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

520
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:26,647
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

521
00:58:35,567 --> 00:58:39,287
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

522
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:42,327
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

523
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:46,047
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

524
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:50,207
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

525
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:56,007
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

526
00:58:56,207 --> 00:58:58,167
Up!

527
00:58:58,407 --> 00:58:59,367
Up.

528
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,687
Up.

529
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:06,007
Up. Up!

530
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:08,207
With feeling.

531
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,007
Shut up, Harry.

532
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:23,887
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

533
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:28,087
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

534
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:33,447
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

535
00:59:33,647 --> 00:59:37,487
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

536
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:42,007
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

537
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:45,367
On my whistle. Three, two...

538
00:59:47,807 --> 00:59:49,167
Mr. Longbottom.

539
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,687
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

540
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:58,127
Neville!

541
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,128
Help!

542
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:04,527
Come back down this instant!

543
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:35,887
Everyone out of the way!

544
01:00:41,447 --> 01:00:43,607
Is he all right?

545
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:49,647
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

546
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:55,607
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

547
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:59,487
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

548
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:04,967
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

549
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:07,087
Did you see his face?

550
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:11,127
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

551
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:13,847
Give it here, Malfoy.

552
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:18,367
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

553
01:01:22,567 --> 01:01:25,007
How about on the roof?

554
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:30,007
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

555
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:36,367
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

556
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,487
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

557
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,687
What an idiot.

558
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:48,567
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

559
01:01:48,807 --> 01:01:50,927
Is that so?

560
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,327
Have it your way, then.

561
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:32,687
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

562
01:02:32,927 --> 01:02:34,967
Harry Potter!

563
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,927
Follow me.

564
01:02:49,607 --> 01:02:51,847
You wait here.

565
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:58,887
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

566
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:00,927
Yes, of course.

567
01:03:06,607 --> 01:03:12,367
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

568
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:17,967
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

569
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,407
I always knew he'd do well.

570
01:03:20,887 --> 01:03:24,927
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

571
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:29,647
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

572
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,487
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

573
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:35,167
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

574
01:03:35,407 --> 01:03:39,087
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

575
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:41,967
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

576
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:46,167
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

577
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:49,127
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

578
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:55,007
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

579
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:58,407
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

580
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:03,647
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

581
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:16,007
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

582
01:04:16,847 --> 01:04:19,047
I didn't know.

583
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:28,167
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

584
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:30,647
Who doesn't?

585
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,687
What's happening?

586
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:38,127
The staircases change, remember?

587
01:04:43,607 --> 01:04:48,047
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

588
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:59,087
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

589
01:04:59,367 --> 01:05:01,487
We're not supposed to be here.

590
01:05:01,687 --> 01:05:05,607
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

591
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:08,367
Let's go.

592
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:13,447
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

593
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,567
Quick, let's hide through that door!

594
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:27,767
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

595
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:30,127
Move over!

596
01:05:31,087 --> 01:05:33,207
Alohomora.

597
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:36,007
Get in.

598
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:38,367
Alohomora?

599
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,087
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

600
01:05:41,327 --> 01:05:44,687
Anyone here, my sweet?

601
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:51,927
Come on.

602
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,287
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

603
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:59,167
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

604
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Push...!!!

605
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:30,327
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

606
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,207
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

607
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:38,567
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

608
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:41,647
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

609
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:45,527
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

610
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:49,287
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

611
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,447
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

612
01:06:53,687 --> 01:06:57,287
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

613
01:06:57,527 --> 01:07:00,647
Or worse, expelled.

614
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:08,167
She needs to sort out her priorities.

615
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:17,007
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

616
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:22,927
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

617
01:07:28,007 --> 01:07:32,127
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

618
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:38,287
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

619
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:42,887
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

620
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:47,567
I think so. What are those?

621
01:07:49,847 --> 01:07:52,007
You better take this.

622
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:04,887
Careful now, it's coming back.

623
01:08:11,447 --> 01:08:15,087
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

624
01:08:31,727 --> 01:08:34,007
What was that?

625
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:38,527
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

626
01:08:38,727 --> 01:08:42,247
But you are a Seeker.

627
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:50,407
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

628
01:08:50,647 --> 01:08:53,167
The Golden Snitch.

629
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:56,367
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

630
01:08:56,607 --> 01:09:00,607
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

631
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:02,767
What do I do with it?

632
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:06,207
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

633
01:09:06,487 --> 01:09:08,927
You catch this, the game's over.

634
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:13,087
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

635
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Wow...

636
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:27,487
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

637
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:31,687
...or the ability to make objects fly.

638
01:09:31,887 --> 01:09:34,287
Do you have your feathers? Good.

639
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:39,687
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

640
01:09:39,887 --> 01:09:43,207
The swish and flick. Everyone.

641
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:49,407
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

642
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:54,407
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

643
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:57,927
Wingardium Leviosa.

644
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:00,527
Wingardium Leviosa.

645
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,607
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

646
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:14,847
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

647
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:19,647
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

648
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:23,967
Wingardium Leviosa.

649
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:37,127
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

650
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:39,967
Splendid!

651
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:42,767
Well done, dear.

652
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:51,087
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

653
01:10:57,567 --> 01:11:01,847
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

654
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:07,447
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

655
01:11:08,087 --> 01:11:10,647
I think she heard you.

656
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:41,367
Where's Hermione?

657
01:11:41,607 --> 01:11:44,727
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

658
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:49,007
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

659
01:11:53,447 --> 01:11:57,087
Troll in the dungeon!

660
01:11:57,367 --> 01:12:00,687
Troll in the dungeon!

661
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,807
Thought you ought to know.

662
01:12:12,687 --> 01:12:15,527
Silence!

663
01:12:17,127 --> 01:12:21,167
Everyone will please not panic!

664
01:12:21,847 --> 01:12:23,407
Now...

665
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:28,167
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

666
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:33,687
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

667
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,887
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

668
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,847
How could a troll get in?

669
01:12:50,087 --> 01:12:55,247
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

670
01:12:55,447 --> 01:12:59,447
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

671
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,807
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

672
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:20,847
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

673
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,247
Hermione, move!

674
01:13:57,647 --> 01:14:01,767
Help! Help!

675
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:05,847
Hey, pea brain!

676
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,167
Help!

677
01:14:41,327 --> 01:14:43,687
Do something!

678
01:14:45,087 --> 01:14:48,987
- What?
- Anything!

679
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,527
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

680
01:14:51,727 --> 01:14:54,049
Wingardium Leviosa.

681
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:06,969
Cool.

682
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:34,213
Is it dead?

683
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:38,373
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

684
01:15:44,615 --> 01:15:46,935
Troll boogers.

685
01:15:49,455 --> 01:15:53,015
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

686
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,855
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

687
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:01,217
Miss Granger?

688
01:16:02,097 --> 01:16:07,177
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

689
01:16:07,377 --> 01:16:09,257
But I was wrong.

690
01:16:09,457 --> 01:16:14,537
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

691
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:19,939
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

692
01:16:20,139 --> 01:16:25,819
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

693
01:16:26,019 --> 01:16:29,019
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

694
01:16:29,259 --> 01:16:32,819
...for your serious lack of judgment.

695
01:16:33,299 --> 01:16:35,301
As for you two gentlemen...

696
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,941
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

697
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:42,541
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

698
01:16:42,781 --> 01:16:45,381
...and live to tell the tale.

699
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:48,061
Five points...

700
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:52,583
...will be awarded to each of you...

701
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,223
...for sheer dumb luck.

702
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:06,583
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

703
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:20,295
- Good of you to get us out of trouble.
- We did save her life.

704
01:17:20,775 --> 01:17:25,137
She might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

705
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:28,657
What are friends for?

706
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:33,527
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

707
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:36,927
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

708
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:39,367
I'm not hungry.

709
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:45,569
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

710
01:17:45,769 --> 01:17:48,969
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

711
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:52,289
Even if it is against Slytherin.

712
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:03,371
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

713
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:07,931
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

714
01:18:08,131 --> 01:18:10,811
...so he could get past that dog.

715
01:18:11,011 --> 01:18:13,771
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

716
01:18:14,011 --> 01:18:16,253
But why would anyone go near that dog?

717
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:20,173
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

718
01:18:20,373 --> 01:18:23,613
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

719
01:18:23,813 --> 01:18:24,933
You're saying...

720
01:18:25,173 --> 01:18:29,653
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

721
01:18:42,815 --> 01:18:46,775
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

722
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,857
Let's open it.

723
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:00,297
It's a broomstick.

724
01:19:01,057 --> 01:19:05,217
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

725
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,699
But who?

726
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:32,861
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

727
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:36,741
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

728
01:19:36,941 --> 01:19:40,463
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

729
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:43,423
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

730
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:46,463
Woke up in hospital a week later.

731
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:12,025
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

732
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:16,947
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

733
01:20:47,231 --> 01:20:49,711
The players take their positions...

734
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:53,711
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

735
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:57,231
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

736
01:20:57,871 --> 01:21:00,311
...from all of you!

737
01:21:05,433 --> 01:21:08,353
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

738
01:21:08,553 --> 01:21:11,273
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

739
01:21:11,473 --> 01:21:15,273
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

740
01:21:21,395 --> 01:21:25,515
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

741
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:48,997
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

742
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,398
GRYFFINDOR

743
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:55,479
Well done!

744
01:21:59,879 --> 01:22:05,559
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

745
01:22:37,603 --> 01:22:40,403
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

746
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
GRYFFINDOR - SLYTHERIN

747
01:22:54,205 --> 01:22:56,085
Give me that!

748
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
SLYTHERIN

749
01:23:27,529 --> 01:23:30,169
Take that side!

750
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,300
GRYFFINDOR - SLYTHERIN

751
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:22,895
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

752
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,017
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

753
01:24:34,257 --> 01:24:38,617
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

754
01:25:00,381 --> 01:25:01,941
Come on, Hermione!

755
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:19,783
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

756
01:25:26,863 --> 01:25:29,943
Fire! You're on fire!

757
01:25:47,785 --> 01:25:49,947
Go, go, go, go!

758
01:26:41,953 --> 01:26:44,313
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

759
01:26:45,393 --> 01:26:46,833
He's got the Snitch!

760
01:26:47,073 --> 01:26:51,153
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

761
01:26:51,353 --> 01:26:53,033
Gryffindor wins!

762
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:40,879
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

763
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:44,999
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

764
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,641
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

765
01:27:47,841 --> 01:27:51,521
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

766
01:27:51,721 --> 01:27:57,001
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

767
01:27:57,201 --> 01:28:01,801
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

768
01:28:02,401 --> 01:28:06,403
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

769
01:28:06,603 --> 01:28:10,083
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

770
01:28:10,563 --> 01:28:15,643
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

771
01:28:15,883 --> 01:28:19,443
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

772
01:28:19,645 --> 01:28:21,925
Exactly.

773
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:25,325
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

774
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:30,205
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

775
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:35,525
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

776
01:28:35,725 --> 01:28:37,127
Nicholas Flamel?

777
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:42,847
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

778
01:28:43,047 --> 01:28:47,167
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

779
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:49,367
I don't know.

780
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:11,051
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

781
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:14,091
Ring the Hogwart bell

782
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:17,091
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

783
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:20,211
Cast a Christmas spell

784
01:29:33,813 --> 01:29:37,173
Knight to e5.

785
01:29:44,855 --> 01:29:47,015
Queen to e5.

786
01:29:52,655 --> 01:29:54,055
That's totally barbaric!

787
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:58,215
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

788
01:29:58,455 --> 01:29:59,895
I see you haven't.

789
01:30:00,255 --> 01:30:05,417
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

790
01:30:05,617 --> 01:30:09,457
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

791
01:30:09,657 --> 01:30:13,017
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

792
01:30:13,257 --> 01:30:16,737
We've looked a hundred times!

793
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:22,619
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

794
01:30:24,859 --> 01:30:27,779
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

795
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:34,661
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

796
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:47,821
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

797
01:30:48,021 --> 01:30:50,261
What are you wearing?

798
01:30:50,823 --> 01:30:54,543
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

799
01:30:55,663 --> 01:30:58,103
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

800
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:07,585
There they are.

801
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:22,105
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

802
01:31:22,345 --> 01:31:26,507
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

803
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:47,029
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

804
01:31:47,309 --> 01:31:50,229
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

805
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:56,949
My body's gone!

806
01:31:57,149 --> 01:32:00,751
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

807
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:03,191
I'm invisible?

808
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:08,071
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

809
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:13,351
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

810
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,000
RESTRICTED

811
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:47,275
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

812
01:32:47,515 --> 01:32:53,357
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

813
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,079
Who's there?

814
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:25,841
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

815
01:33:33,201 --> 01:33:36,961
Who is it? Show yourself.

816
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:25,527
Severus, I...

817
01:34:26,207 --> 01:34:30,089
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

818
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:35,009
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

819
01:34:52,211 --> 01:34:55,451
We'll have another little chat soon.

820
01:34:55,651 --> 01:35:01,091
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

821
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:05,773
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

822
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:11,373
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

823
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:45,305
Mum?

824
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:50,545
Dad?

825
01:37:25,309 --> 01:37:30,269
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

826
01:37:32,109 --> 01:37:34,991
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

827
01:37:35,191 --> 01:37:38,791
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

828
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:49,791
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

829
01:37:51,273 --> 01:37:53,233
I only see us.

830
01:37:53,473 --> 01:37:56,793
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

831
01:37:57,033 --> 01:38:02,953
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

832
01:38:03,433 --> 01:38:05,793
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

833
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:10,195
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

834
01:38:11,315 --> 01:38:13,795
I look good.

835
01:38:14,395 --> 01:38:18,235
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

836
01:38:18,435 --> 01:38:23,435
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

837
01:38:37,017 --> 01:38:39,297
Do you like yours, Ron?

838
01:38:43,259 --> 01:38:47,219
- Ron?
- I'll be right back.

839
01:38:57,059 --> 01:39:00,381
- Wanna play chess?
- No.

840
01:39:00,621 --> 01:39:05,141
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
- No.

841
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:08,901
I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

842
01:39:09,101 --> 01:39:13,061
There's something not right
about that mirror.

843
01:39:39,565 --> 01:39:41,725
Back again, Harry?

844
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:47,325
I see that you,
like many before you...

845
01:39:47,525 --> 01:39:51,727
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

846
01:39:52,047 --> 01:39:56,207
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

847
01:39:57,527 --> 01:40:00,047
Let me give you a clue.

848
01:40:00,607 --> 01:40:02,727
The happiest man on earth...

849
01:40:02,927 --> 01:40:06,329
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

850
01:40:06,529 --> 01:40:08,849
...exactly as he is.

851
01:40:09,049 --> 01:40:14,129
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

852
01:40:14,329 --> 01:40:17,089
Yes. And no.

853
01:40:18,129 --> 01:40:20,569
It shows us nothing more or less...

854
01:40:20,769 --> 01:40:26,771
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

855
01:40:26,971 --> 01:40:31,691
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

856
01:40:31,891 --> 01:40:35,771
...you see them standing beside you.

857
01:40:35,971 --> 01:40:38,371
But remember this, Harry.

858
01:40:38,653 --> 01:40:44,533
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

859
01:40:44,733 --> 01:40:46,853
...or truth.

860
01:40:47,813 --> 01:40:53,853
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

861
01:40:54,893 --> 01:40:59,055
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

862
01:40:59,255 --> 01:41:01,175
And I must ask you...

863
01:41:02,135 --> 01:41:06,015
...not to go looking for it again.

864
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:09,895
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

865
01:41:10,455 --> 01:41:13,337
...and forget to live.

866
01:42:09,603 --> 01:42:11,683
Hi, Hedwig.

867
01:42:13,443 --> 01:42:17,323
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

868
01:42:17,563 --> 01:42:19,605
We've got final exams soon.

869
01:42:19,885 --> 01:42:22,365
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

870
01:42:22,605 --> 01:42:26,925
What are the ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

871
01:42:27,165 --> 01:42:28,365
I forgot.

872
01:42:28,685 --> 01:42:31,605
What do you plan to do
if it's in the exam?

873
01:42:31,885 --> 01:42:33,885
- Copy off you.
- No, you won't.

874
01:42:34,165 --> 01:42:40,007
Besides, we're to be given special
quills with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

875
01:42:40,247 --> 01:42:46,567
That's insulting! It's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

876
01:42:50,207 --> 01:42:54,249
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

877
01:42:59,409 --> 01:43:02,489
You have got to start
standing up to people.

878
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:06,209
How? I can barely stand at all!

879
01:43:06,489 --> 01:43:08,489
I'll do the countercurse!

880
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:13,091
No, that's all I need!
You to set my kneecaps on fire!

881
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:16,571
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

882
01:43:16,851 --> 01:43:19,931
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

883
01:43:20,211 --> 01:43:24,531
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

884
01:43:27,973 --> 01:43:30,133
I found him!

885
01:43:30,293 --> 01:43:35,373
"Dumbledore is famous for defeating
the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

886
01:43:35,653 --> 01:43:38,813
- Go on!
- "For discovering dragon blood...

887
01:43:39,013 --> 01:43:42,093
...and his alchemy work
with Nicholas Flamel"!

888
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:45,655
I knew it was familiar.
I read it on the train.

889
01:43:45,935 --> 01:43:48,295
Follow me!

890
01:43:53,015 --> 01:43:55,775
Wait! Where are you going?

891
01:43:57,535 --> 01:44:00,857
What about the countercurse?

892
01:44:02,327 --> 01:44:08,007
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

893
01:44:08,247 --> 01:44:11,367
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

894
01:44:11,567 --> 01:44:13,567
This is light?

895
01:44:18,129 --> 01:44:20,569
Of course! Here it is!

896
01:44:20,769 --> 01:44:24,769
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

897
01:44:25,049 --> 01:44:26,209
The what?

898
01:44:26,849 --> 01:44:29,889
Honestly, don't you two read?

899
01:44:30,089 --> 01:44:34,571
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

900
01:44:34,811 --> 01:44:37,411
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

901
01:44:37,611 --> 01:44:41,651
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

902
01:44:41,851 --> 01:44:44,011
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

903
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:46,291
I know what it means!

904
01:44:47,171 --> 01:44:51,893
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

905
01:44:52,093 --> 01:44:57,293
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

906
01:44:58,973 --> 01:45:01,173
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

907
01:45:01,373 --> 01:45:06,093
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

908
01:45:22,855 --> 01:45:26,657
- Hagrid. - Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

909
01:45:26,857 --> 01:45:29,577
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

910
01:45:34,257 --> 01:45:39,417
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

911
01:45:39,617 --> 01:45:42,419
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

912
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:46,939
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

913
01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:48,299
What?

914
01:45:48,459 --> 01:45:51,859
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

915
01:45:52,099 --> 01:45:54,739
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

916
01:45:54,979 --> 01:45:58,861
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

917
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:01,661
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

918
01:46:01,941 --> 01:46:04,981
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

919
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:07,261
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

920
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:11,141
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

921
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:14,983
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

922
01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:33,905
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

923
01:46:34,185 --> 01:46:36,185
I know what that is!

924
01:46:36,385 --> 01:46:39,025
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

925
01:46:39,385 --> 01:46:42,625
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

926
01:46:42,865 --> 01:46:46,945
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

927
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:11,389
Is that...

928
01:47:12,189 --> 01:47:13,349
...a dragon?

929
01:47:13,549 --> 01:47:17,989
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

930
01:47:18,189 --> 01:47:21,069
My brother works
with these in Romania.

931
01:47:21,269 --> 01:47:26,151
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

932
01:47:26,831 --> 01:47:28,551
Hello, Norbert.

933
01:47:28,911 --> 01:47:33,191
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

934
01:47:33,951 --> 01:47:36,391
Don't you, Norbert?

935
01:47:43,393 --> 01:47:46,513
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

936
01:47:50,393 --> 01:47:52,473
Who's that?

937
01:47:54,193 --> 01:47:56,275
Malfoy.

938
01:47:57,035 --> 01:47:58,435
Oh, dear.

939
01:48:00,155 --> 01:48:04,955
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

940
01:48:05,155 --> 01:48:09,195
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

941
01:48:09,395 --> 01:48:13,477
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

942
01:48:13,797 --> 01:48:15,957
Good evening.

943
01:48:19,597 --> 01:48:22,517
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

944
01:48:22,757 --> 01:48:26,277
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

945
01:48:26,477 --> 01:48:31,359
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

946
01:48:31,559 --> 01:48:33,879
- 50?!
- Each.

947
01:48:34,919 --> 01:48:37,319
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

948
01:48:37,519 --> 01:48:40,839
...all four of you
will receive detention.

949
01:48:41,759 --> 01:48:44,719
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

950
01:48:44,959 --> 01:48:47,281
I thought you said the four of us.

951
01:48:47,481 --> 01:48:50,001
No, you heard me correctly.

952
01:48:50,201 --> 01:48:55,201
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

953
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:58,641
You will join your classmates
in detention.

954
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:13,843
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

955
01:49:14,043 --> 01:49:18,763
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

956
01:49:18,963 --> 01:49:21,805
God, I miss the screaming.

957
01:49:24,365 --> 01:49:27,645
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

958
01:49:27,885 --> 01:49:33,205
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

959
01:49:35,285 --> 01:49:38,247
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

960
01:49:39,727 --> 01:49:44,727
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

961
01:49:46,967 --> 01:49:49,047
Norbert's gone.

962
01:49:49,607 --> 01:49:53,129
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

963
01:49:53,449 --> 01:49:56,689
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

964
01:49:56,849 --> 01:49:59,209
What if he don't like Romania?

965
01:49:59,409 --> 01:50:03,649
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

966
01:50:04,289 --> 01:50:09,531
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

967
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:12,131
Got to have your wits about you.

968
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:18,011
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

969
01:50:18,451 --> 01:50:22,291
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

970
01:50:23,851 --> 01:50:25,091
...werewolves.

971
01:50:25,531 --> 01:50:28,813
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

972
01:50:29,013 --> 01:50:31,693
You can be sure of that.

973
01:50:33,653 --> 01:50:35,053
Nighty-night.

974
01:50:37,653 --> 01:50:40,493
Right. Let's go.

975
01:51:18,699 --> 01:51:21,139
Hagrid, what is that?

976
01:51:21,339 --> 01:51:24,699
What we're here for.
See that?

977
01:51:25,219 --> 01:51:30,579
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

978
01:51:31,139 --> 01:51:35,741
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

979
01:51:43,221 --> 01:51:48,981
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

980
01:51:49,181 --> 01:51:52,343
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

981
01:51:52,783 --> 01:51:56,063
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

982
01:51:57,343 --> 01:51:59,623
Okay. Then I get Fang.

983
01:51:59,783 --> 01:52:05,543
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

984
01:52:09,225 --> 01:52:14,225
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

985
01:52:14,425 --> 01:52:18,345
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

986
01:52:18,545 --> 01:52:21,145
I'm not scared, Potter.

987
01:52:22,265 --> 01:52:24,227
Do you hear that?

988
01:52:26,787 --> 01:52:28,187
Come on, Fang.

989
01:52:28,387 --> 01:52:29,907
Scared!

990
01:52:54,909 --> 01:52:57,069
What is it, Fang?

991
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:12,000
Help!

992
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:12,919
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

993
01:54:13,159 --> 01:54:17,159
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

994
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:20,119
What was that thing you saved me from?

995
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:25,641
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

996
01:54:25,881 --> 01:54:31,401
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

997
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:36,721
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

998
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:41,763
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

999
01:54:41,963 --> 01:54:43,763
A cursed life.

1000
01:54:43,963 --> 01:54:47,923
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

1001
01:54:48,163 --> 01:54:53,123
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

1002
01:54:53,443 --> 01:54:57,365
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

1003
01:54:57,565 --> 01:55:02,725
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

1004
01:55:03,565 --> 01:55:05,125
The Philosopher's Stone.

1005
01:55:06,445 --> 01:55:08,445
Harry!

1006
01:55:09,045 --> 01:55:13,567
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

1007
01:55:13,767 --> 01:55:15,927
You all right there, Harry?

1008
01:55:17,047 --> 01:55:21,367
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

1009
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:26,047
You're safe now. Good luck.

1010
01:55:33,689 --> 01:55:37,809
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

1011
01:55:38,049 --> 01:55:40,809
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

1012
01:55:41,049 --> 01:55:43,969
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

1013
01:55:44,169 --> 01:55:48,531
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

1014
01:55:48,771 --> 01:55:53,291
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1015
01:55:53,491 --> 01:55:55,091
He'll come back.

1016
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:57,051
But if he comes back...

1017
01:55:57,291 --> 01:56:01,251
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

1018
01:56:02,253 --> 01:56:05,813
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

1019
01:56:06,013 --> 01:56:09,613
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

1020
01:56:09,813 --> 01:56:13,413
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1021
01:56:13,773 --> 01:56:18,653
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1022
01:56:19,415 --> 01:56:24,535
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1023
01:56:24,735 --> 01:56:28,815
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1024
01:56:34,535 --> 01:56:39,977
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

1025
01:56:40,177 --> 01:56:43,857
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1026
01:56:44,057 --> 01:56:49,257
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

1027
01:56:49,457 --> 01:56:52,097
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

1028
01:56:52,337 --> 01:56:55,819
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

1029
01:57:03,459 --> 01:57:05,939
- Of course!
- What is it?

1030
01:57:06,139 --> 01:57:09,901
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

1031
01:57:10,101 --> 01:57:13,181
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

1032
01:57:13,381 --> 01:57:16,061
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

1033
01:57:16,261 --> 01:57:18,541
Why didn't I see it before?

1034
01:57:24,101 --> 01:57:27,623
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

1035
01:57:27,823 --> 01:57:30,583
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1036
01:57:30,783 --> 01:57:33,383
You and this stranger
must have talked.

1037
01:57:33,943 --> 01:57:37,503
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1038
01:57:37,703 --> 01:57:41,703
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1039
01:57:41,903 --> 01:57:46,385
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

1040
01:57:46,785 --> 01:57:50,985
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

1041
01:57:51,185 --> 01:57:56,825
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

1042
01:57:57,025 --> 01:58:02,507
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1043
01:58:04,107 --> 01:58:06,827
I shouldn't have told you that.

1044
01:58:07,067 --> 01:58:09,267
Where are you going?

1045
01:58:16,307 --> 01:58:19,029
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1046
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:22,149
I'm afraid he's not here.

1047
01:58:22,349 --> 01:58:26,629
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

1048
01:58:27,069 --> 01:58:29,589
He's gone?
But this is important!

1049
01:58:29,869 --> 01:58:32,069
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1050
01:58:33,991 --> 01:58:37,711
- How do you know?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

1051
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:43,551
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

1052
01:58:43,751 --> 01:58:48,031
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1053
01:58:56,353 --> 01:58:59,153
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

1054
01:58:59,353 --> 01:59:01,993
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1055
01:59:02,233 --> 01:59:06,113
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

1056
01:59:08,155 --> 01:59:11,235
What would three young Gryffindors...

1057
01:59:11,475 --> 01:59:15,795
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1058
01:59:20,515 --> 01:59:24,077
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

1059
01:59:24,637 --> 01:59:26,597
People will think you're...

1060
01:59:30,877 --> 01:59:33,597
...up to something.

1061
01:59:43,879 --> 01:59:45,879
Now what do we do?

1062
01:59:46,119 --> 01:59:49,839
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1063
02:00:03,641 --> 02:00:05,081
Trevor.

1064
02:00:05,401 --> 02:00:08,841
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

1065
02:00:09,081 --> 02:00:14,523
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1066
02:00:14,723 --> 02:00:18,683
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

1067
02:00:18,923 --> 02:00:23,523
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

1068
02:00:23,723 --> 02:00:28,043
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1069
02:00:36,005 --> 02:00:39,805
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1070
02:00:40,045 --> 02:00:43,685
Brilliant, but scary.

1071
02:00:44,325 --> 02:00:46,365
Let's go.

1072
02:00:46,605 --> 02:00:50,847
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

1073
02:00:56,247 --> 02:01:00,247
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

1074
02:01:04,087 --> 02:01:06,169
Alohomora.

1075
02:01:18,169 --> 02:01:20,729
Wait a minute. He's...

1076
02:01:21,971 --> 02:01:24,131
...snoring.

1077
02:01:26,651 --> 02:01:32,171
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1078
02:01:33,771 --> 02:01:36,771
It's got horrible breath.

1079
02:01:39,373 --> 02:01:41,453
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1080
02:01:41,653 --> 02:01:43,053
Come on!

1081
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:49,213
Okay. Push.

1082
02:02:12,337 --> 02:02:15,977
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1083
02:02:16,177 --> 02:02:21,177
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1084
02:02:21,977 --> 02:02:25,457
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1085
02:02:26,137 --> 02:02:27,977
The harp.

1086
02:02:28,659 --> 02:02:31,379
It's stopped playing.

1087
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:37,000
Yah!

1088
02:02:41,419 --> 02:02:45,539
Jump!

1089
02:02:56,741 --> 02:03:00,341
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1090
02:03:14,783 --> 02:03:17,863
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1091
02:03:18,103 --> 02:03:21,785
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1092
02:03:22,025 --> 02:03:27,025
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1093
02:03:29,265 --> 02:03:30,585
Hermione!

1094
02:03:31,185 --> 02:03:34,985
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1095
02:03:35,185 --> 02:03:39,707
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1096
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,000
Harry!

1097
02:03:46,787 --> 02:03:50,107
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1098
02:03:50,347 --> 02:03:53,389
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1099
02:03:53,589 --> 02:03:56,149
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1100
02:03:56,349 --> 02:03:59,269
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1101
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:03,989
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1102
02:04:04,189 --> 02:04:08,549
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1103
02:04:08,829 --> 02:04:10,871
Lumus Solem.

1104
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:21,551
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1105
02:04:24,231 --> 02:04:26,713
Lucky we didn't panic.

1106
02:04:27,473 --> 02:04:30,953
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1107
02:04:32,593 --> 02:04:34,073
What is that?

1108
02:04:34,313 --> 02:04:37,993
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1109
02:04:51,155 --> 02:04:54,595
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1110
02:04:54,835 --> 02:04:58,435
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1111
02:04:58,675 --> 02:05:02,117
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1112
02:05:05,597 --> 02:05:10,197
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1113
02:05:16,077 --> 02:05:18,159
Strange.

1114
02:05:18,559 --> 02:05:20,839
Alohomora!

1115
02:05:23,799 --> 02:05:26,079
Well, it was worth a try.

1116
02:05:26,279 --> 02:05:29,519
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1117
02:05:29,719 --> 02:05:33,641
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1118
02:05:33,881 --> 02:05:37,281
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1119
02:05:40,881 --> 02:05:43,201
What's wrong?

1120
02:05:44,081 --> 02:05:45,601
It's too simple.

1121
02:05:45,801 --> 02:05:50,563
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1122
02:05:50,763 --> 02:05:54,323
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1123
02:06:11,165 --> 02:06:14,165
This complicates things a bit.

1124
02:06:35,447 --> 02:06:37,367
Catch the key!

1125
02:06:41,769 --> 02:06:43,689
Hurry up!

1126
02:07:16,173 --> 02:07:20,853
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1127
02:07:21,053 --> 02:07:24,253
Where are we? A graveyard.

1128
02:07:24,613 --> 02:07:27,253
This is no graveyard.

1129
02:07:34,735 --> 02:07:37,655
It's a chessboard.

1130
02:07:49,657 --> 02:07:51,577
There's the door.

1131
02:08:03,617 --> 02:08:05,139
Now what do we do?

1132
02:08:05,499 --> 02:08:09,619
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1133
02:08:10,219 --> 02:08:13,979
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1134
02:08:14,299 --> 02:08:18,499
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1135
02:08:18,779 --> 02:08:22,821
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1136
02:08:29,981 --> 02:08:31,701
What happens now?

1137
02:08:32,501 --> 02:08:35,501
Well, white moves first.

1138
02:08:35,701 --> 02:08:37,581
And then...

1139
02:08:39,343 --> 02:08:40,583
...we play.

1140
02:08:51,183 --> 02:08:56,225
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1141
02:08:56,465 --> 02:09:00,025
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1142
02:09:00,385 --> 02:09:03,345
You there, d5.

1143
02:09:17,947 --> 02:09:19,547
Yes, Hermione.

1144
02:09:19,747 --> 02:09:24,827
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1145
02:09:30,749 --> 02:09:33,269
Castle to e4!

1146
02:09:36,869 --> 02:09:39,189
Pawn to c3!

1147
02:10:23,835 --> 02:10:27,835
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1148
02:10:28,075 --> 02:10:32,795
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1149
02:10:33,395 --> 02:10:35,757
Then you're free to check the king.

1150
02:10:35,957 --> 02:10:38,677
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1151
02:10:39,277 --> 02:10:43,957
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1152
02:10:44,157 --> 02:10:47,917
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1153
02:10:48,117 --> 02:10:51,717
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1154
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:54,959
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1155
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:08,159
Knight to h3.

1156
02:11:29,083 --> 02:11:31,083
Check.

1157
02:12:00,247 --> 02:12:02,047
Ron!

1158
02:12:02,247 --> 02:12:08,047
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1159
02:12:23,129 --> 02:12:24,409
Checkmate.

1160
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:46,851
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1161
02:12:47,051 --> 02:12:50,933
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1162
02:12:51,133 --> 02:12:53,013
I have to go on.

1163
02:12:53,533 --> 02:12:59,453
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1164
02:12:59,653 --> 02:13:02,173
Not as good as you.

1165
02:13:03,013 --> 02:13:07,815
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1166
02:13:09,055 --> 02:13:14,655
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1167
02:13:52,739 --> 02:13:54,419
You?

1168
02:13:55,219 --> 02:13:59,061
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1169
02:13:59,261 --> 02:14:02,301
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1170
02:14:02,501 --> 02:14:05,661
Next to him, who would suspect...

1171
02:14:05,861 --> 02:14:09,781
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1172
02:14:09,981 --> 02:14:15,383
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1173
02:14:15,583 --> 02:14:18,383
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1174
02:14:18,863 --> 02:14:23,023
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1175
02:14:23,263 --> 02:14:25,463
...I would have succeeded.

1176
02:14:25,663 --> 02:14:28,663
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1177
02:14:28,863 --> 02:14:31,105
Snape was trying to save me?

1178
02:14:31,305 --> 02:14:36,625
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1179
02:14:36,865 --> 02:14:41,105
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1180
02:14:41,305 --> 02:14:44,305
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1181
02:14:44,905 --> 02:14:49,867
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1182
02:14:50,787 --> 02:14:54,267
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1183
02:14:55,307 --> 02:15:00,547
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1184
02:15:00,747 --> 02:15:04,789
I'm never alone. Never.

1185
02:15:04,989 --> 02:15:09,109
Now, what does this mirror do?

1186
02:15:10,669 --> 02:15:12,789
I see what I desire.

1187
02:15:13,349 --> 02:15:17,789
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1188
02:15:17,989 --> 02:15:20,149
Use the boy.

1189
02:15:20,951 --> 02:15:24,871
Come here, Potter! Now!

1190
02:15:36,951 --> 02:15:40,953
Tell me, what do you see?

1191
02:16:06,115 --> 02:16:08,515
What is it? What do you see?

1192
02:16:08,755 --> 02:16:13,917
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1193
02:16:14,117 --> 02:16:15,677
He lies.

1194
02:16:16,157 --> 02:16:19,877
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1195
02:16:20,077 --> 02:16:24,477
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1196
02:16:24,717 --> 02:16:28,719
I have strength enough for this.

1197
02:16:46,921 --> 02:16:49,801
Harry Potter...

1198
02:16:50,001 --> 02:16:52,321
...we meet again.

1199
02:16:52,561 --> 02:16:53,961
Voldemort.

1200
02:16:54,161 --> 02:16:58,121
Yes. You see what I've become?

1201
02:16:58,401 --> 02:17:01,963
See what I must do to survive?

1202
02:17:02,163 --> 02:17:06,323
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1203
02:17:06,963 --> 02:17:10,323
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1204
02:17:10,523 --> 02:17:14,203
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1205
02:17:14,403 --> 02:17:17,963
But there is something that can.

1206
02:17:18,163 --> 02:17:23,845
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1207
02:17:24,205 --> 02:17:25,765
Stop him!

1208
02:17:30,805 --> 02:17:33,565
Don't be a fool.

1209
02:17:34,045 --> 02:17:37,167
Why suffer an horrific death...

1210
02:17:37,367 --> 02:17:41,007
...when you can join me and live?

1211
02:17:41,207 --> 02:17:42,287
Never!

1212
02:17:44,327 --> 02:17:49,087
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1213
02:17:49,847 --> 02:17:53,169
Tell me, Harry...

1214
02:17:53,409 --> 02:17:57,289
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1215
02:17:57,529 --> 02:17:59,609
Together...

1216
02:17:59,809 --> 02:18:02,369
...we can bring them back.

1217
02:18:02,769 --> 02:18:07,489
All I ask is for something in return.

1218
02:18:14,211 --> 02:18:17,331
That's it, Harry.

1219
02:18:18,211 --> 02:18:22,091
There is no good and evil.

1220
02:18:22,291 --> 02:18:25,331
There is only power...

1221
02:18:25,533 --> 02:18:29,653
...and those too weak to seek it.

1222
02:18:30,333 --> 02:18:35,373
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1223
02:18:35,773 --> 02:18:38,053
Just give me the Stone!

1224
02:18:40,653 --> 02:18:41,813
You liar!

1225
02:18:42,053 --> 02:18:44,175
Kill him!

1226
02:19:07,697 --> 02:19:13,017
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1227
02:20:58,311 --> 02:21:00,831
Good afternoon, Harry.

1228
02:21:02,951 --> 02:21:07,471
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1229
02:21:07,671 --> 02:21:13,673
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1230
02:21:13,873 --> 02:21:18,673
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1231
02:21:20,993 --> 02:21:24,633
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1232
02:21:24,833 --> 02:21:27,673
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1233
02:21:27,873 --> 02:21:30,915
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1234
02:21:31,115 --> 02:21:35,995
Fine. They're both just fine.

1235
02:21:36,555 --> 02:21:39,355
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1236
02:21:39,715 --> 02:21:42,515
The Stone has been destroyed.

1237
02:21:42,795 --> 02:21:46,997
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1238
02:21:47,197 --> 02:21:51,157
...and agreed it was best all around.

1239
02:21:51,397 --> 02:21:55,197
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1240
02:21:57,277 --> 02:22:02,757
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1241
02:22:02,957 --> 02:22:06,199
But yes, he will die.

1242
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:08,839
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1243
02:22:09,079 --> 02:22:11,599
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

1244
02:22:11,799 --> 02:22:15,919
You see, only a person...

1245
02:22:16,199 --> 02:22:20,119
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1246
02:22:20,359 --> 02:22:24,921
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1247
02:22:25,881 --> 02:22:29,361
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1248
02:22:29,601 --> 02:22:34,641
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1249
02:22:36,081 --> 02:22:41,323
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1250
02:22:41,523 --> 02:22:43,843
I'm afraid...

1251
02:22:45,283 --> 02:22:49,323
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1252
02:22:50,043 --> 02:22:52,603
Harry, do you know why...

1253
02:22:52,803 --> 02:22:56,845
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1254
02:22:57,045 --> 02:23:01,685
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1255
02:23:02,205 --> 02:23:05,405
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1256
02:23:05,645 --> 02:23:09,405
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1257
02:23:09,645 --> 02:23:14,567
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1258
02:23:15,407 --> 02:23:19,127
Love, Harry. Love.

1259
02:23:27,207 --> 02:23:31,329
Bertie Bot's Every Flavor Beans.

1260
02:23:31,529 --> 02:23:36,209
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1261
02:23:36,449 --> 02:23:39,729
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1262
02:23:39,969 --> 02:23:43,329
But I think I could be safe...

1263
02:23:43,529 --> 02:23:45,931
...with a nice toffee.

1264
02:23:50,011 --> 02:23:51,571
Alas!

1265
02:23:52,251 --> 02:23:54,371
Earwax.

1266
02:24:09,613 --> 02:24:12,773
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1267
02:24:13,893 --> 02:24:16,613
All right. Hermione?

1268
02:24:17,293 --> 02:24:19,135
Never better.

1269
02:24:34,937 --> 02:24:37,377
Another year gone.

1270
02:24:38,137 --> 02:24:42,697
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1271
02:24:42,897 --> 02:24:45,537
And the points stand thus:

1272
02:24:45,737 --> 02:24:51,537
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1273
02:24:53,499 --> 02:24:59,179
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1274
02:25:04,459 --> 02:25:06,259
In second place...

1275
02:25:06,459 --> 02:25:11,261
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1276
02:25:16,941 --> 02:25:18,661
And in first place...

1277
02:25:18,981 --> 02:25:24,421
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1278
02:25:29,983 --> 02:25:32,223
Nice one, mate.

1279
02:25:36,063 --> 02:25:40,143
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1280
02:25:40,383 --> 02:25:44,665
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1281
02:25:44,905 --> 02:25:49,865
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1282
02:25:50,465 --> 02:25:55,985
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1283
02:25:56,185 --> 02:25:58,987
...while others were in grave peril...

1284
02:25:59,707 --> 02:26:01,947
...50 points.

1285
02:26:02,867 --> 02:26:04,147
Good job.

1286
02:26:11,867 --> 02:26:17,909
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1287
02:26:18,429 --> 02:26:23,669
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1288
02:26:28,309 --> 02:26:30,349
And third...

1289
02:26:30,909 --> 02:26:33,791
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1290
02:26:33,991 --> 02:26:38,271
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1291
02:26:38,871 --> 02:26:43,751
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1292
02:26:52,033 --> 02:26:53,953
We're tied with Slytherin!

1293
02:26:54,193 --> 02:27:00,193
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1294
02:27:00,393 --> 02:27:04,273
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1295
02:27:04,473 --> 02:27:07,435
I award 10 points...

1296
02:27:07,635 --> 02:27:10,875
...to Neville Longbottom.

1297
02:27:24,197 --> 02:27:27,637
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1298
02:27:27,837 --> 02:27:32,397
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1299
02:27:37,437 --> 02:27:40,799
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1300
02:28:18,843 --> 02:28:22,203
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1301
02:28:22,403 --> 02:28:26,683
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1302
02:28:32,125 --> 02:28:35,405
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1303
02:28:41,685 --> 02:28:45,405
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1304
02:28:48,647 --> 02:28:50,487
This is for you.

1305
02:29:07,249 --> 02:29:09,369
Thanks, Hagrid.

1306
02:29:15,209 --> 02:29:19,609
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1307
02:29:20,049 --> 02:29:24,491
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1308
02:29:24,771 --> 02:29:27,411
...you could always threaten him...

1309
02:29:27,651 --> 02:29:30,531
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1310
02:29:30,731 --> 02:29:35,811
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1311
02:29:36,291 --> 02:29:40,613
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1312
02:29:46,133 --> 02:29:49,253
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1313
02:29:49,453 --> 02:29:51,533
I'm not going home.

1314
02:29:51,733 --> 02:29:53,653
Not really.
